;;; Commentary:

;; See <URL:http://www.abridgegame.org/darcs/> concerning darcs.

;; Load this library to register darcs support in VC.

;; There's another implementation like this
;; <URL:http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/repos/vc-darcs>, but
;; it doesn't have a copyright assignment for inclusion in Emacs.  See
;; See <URL:http://chneukirchen.org/repos/darcsum> (which still needs
;; some work) for a more PCL-CVS-like interface more appropriate for a
;; patch-based system.

;; This doesn't deal with revisions in most commands, since darcs is
;; patch-based.  The `diff' and `checkout' handlers (currently) do
;; deal with revision specs -- see the doc of `vc-darcs-rev-to-flags'.
;; However, the VC framework can't deal well with this -- at least
;; avoid slashes in anything specified as a revision name.  There are
;; plenty of loose ends: see the Fixmes below.  VC and log-view need
;; other changes to work more sanely with this darcs stuff -- they
;; still tend to assume RCS/CVS-like features.

;; The package protect-files.el can be used to avoid backup and
;; autosave files in _darcs (see darcs doc).

;;; Code:

;; The following (Emacs 22) VC operations aren't implemented and
;; probably can't or shouldn't be:

;; latest-on-branch-p, init-version [not relevant], receive-file,
;; make-version-backups-p, repository-hostname [the default repo isn't
;; relevant for VC commands], check-headers [doesn't expand headers],
;; clear-headers [likewise], find-file-hook, find-file-not-found-hook,
;; cancel-version [darcs obliterate isn't file-based], merge-news
;; [probably not meant to do something like pull], steal-lock [no
;; locking], state-heuristic [maybe should be], merge,
;; comment-history, update-changelog, assign-name, retrieve-snapshot.

;; Fixmes:
;;
;; * Figure out whether to attempt to do anything with coding
;;   conversion of darcs i/o where relevant.  As far as I can tell,
;;   darcs is currently unreliable with non-ASCII metadata (at least).
;;
;; * find-version is meant to be provided for Emacs 22 VC, rather than
;;   checkout.
;; 
;; * Merge might be implemented as applying patch, but merging to a
;;   single file presumably requires pulling to a scratch branch.
;; 
;; * Should retrieve-snapshot do darcs get?
;; 
;; * Implement update-changelog, but that requires convention for how
;;   to deal with darcs comments.
