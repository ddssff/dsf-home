About Versioned Dependencies on Builtin Packages
------------------------------------------------

If cabal-debian detects that a package is built in to the compiler it is
supposed to generate unversioned dependencies like

    libghc-cabal-dev | ghc, libghc-cabal-prof | ghc-prof,

rather than versioned ones like

    libghc-cabal-dev (>= 2.0.1.0) | ghc, libghc-cabal-dev (<< 2.1) | ghc

Unfortunately, if the cabal file has versions the debian/control files
gets them too.  To build successfully it is necessary to patch the cabal
file.  This introduces some danger of inappropriate versions (of Cabal in
this case,) but makes the build work.
