New technique

When you have a type you want to split into several types, but you
don’t know exactly what they are, create a union type for the
several desired types:

data AppraisalURL path
    = A_Html AppraisalPage
    | A_Partial AppraisalPage
    | A_Lens path
    | A_ImageUpload path
    | A_ImageSideload path
    | A_List ListOp
    | A_Branding (BrandingOp path)
    | A_PlaceHolder String
    | A_File FilePath
    | A_File2 FilePath FilePath
    | ImageDir String
    | JavaScript FilePath
    | ProfileData ProfileDataMap.ProfileDataMap
    | TODO String
    | A_NullURL

+data PathUnion
+    = U1 (AppraisalPath OldT OldT)
+    | U2 (AppraisalPath OldT OldT)
+    | U3 (AppraisalPath OldT OldT)
+    | U4 (AppraisalPath OldT OldT)

Now make each of the four path parameters expect one of the PathUnion
constructors.

data AppraisalURL path
    = A_Html AppraisalPage
    | A_Partial AppraisalPage
    | A_Lens (PathUnion path)
    | A_ImageUpload (PathUnionpath)
    | A_ImageSideload (U3 path)
    | A_List ListOp
    | A_Branding (BrandingOp (P4 path))
    | A_PlaceHolder String
    | A_File FilePath
    | A_File2 FilePath FilePath
    | ImageDir String
    | JavaScript FilePath
    | ProfileData ProfileDataMap.ProfileDataMap
    | TODO String
    | A_NullURL

Get it to compile.  Then change the types of each of PathUnion’s
constructor’s type parameters to what you wanted.
