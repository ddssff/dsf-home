A strategy for literate programming:

1. Create a hacked up implementation of your idea
2. Start writing a coherent story of the idea
3. Drop relevant bits of code between the paragraphs of the story
4. When you get to the end of the story you were able to write,
   Look for left over bits of code and continue the story by
   describing them.  Hopefully the coherent order/story will emerge.
