To Do:

   4. Remove the Item(?)
   5. Show instances for TypePath s a and TypeSPath s
   6. Remove the IsString e constraint
   7. Remove Proxy t arguments from functions that now take TypePath t or TypeSPath t
   9. More quickcheck properties
* 10. Restore schema migration mechanism
  11. Eliminate the nested splice from makePaths so we can use the typegraph stuff in th-typegraph.
      Currently the start type needs to be hard coded.
  12. Implement goKey
* 13. Instead of a Proxy t argument can we add a t parameter to the monad?  Or to TypePath and TypeSPath?
  14. Move the Path.TypeGraph modules to th-typegraph and re-implement the derive functions there


  15. Would be nice to have a Ppr instance for TypeSPath s instead of (Proxy t, TypeSPath s).
      The difficulty is applying the ViewType type function when necessary without the Q monad.
  16. Renamed or replaced:
         expandType' -> unE . expandType
  17. Speed up diff
  18. Eliminate the Query symbols in Data.Path.Paths
  19. Add and use aliases:
        type ATypePath = TypePath AppraisalPaths
        type ATypeSPath = TypeSPath AppraisalPaths
        path' = path [t|AppraisalPaths|]
  20. Rename: goKey' -> goKey, goAt' -> goAt, goOrder' -> goOrder
  21. A Set a is an Ixed instance where Index = a and IxValue = ().  However, our
      IxValue and AtValue classes have two parameters - AtValue o ok.  Can we
      eliminate the ok parameter?
  22. Adding (Set a) to the primitve list should prevent the FieldHop 1 1 - but it doesn't.
