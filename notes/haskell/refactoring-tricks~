1. Wrap a type you want to change with a Newtype and get things to recompile.
   Then you can add fields to it, remove the old fields, then remove the newtype
2. To merge two arguments, replace the first argument with the pair containing
   both, and replace the second with ().  Get it to build, then remove the ().
3. If you suspect a MonadError function has no failure mode, try changing its
   error type to ().  Alternatively, comment out all the constructors in the error
   type and restore each one as needed.
4. Create an error type for each function, creating embedded error types for
   each function it calls.  This lets you find out what errors are truly
   possible for each function.
