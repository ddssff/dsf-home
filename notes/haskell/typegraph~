To Do:

   4. Remove the Item(?)
   5. Show instances for TypePath s a and TypeSPath s
   6. Remove the IsString e constraint
   7. Remove Proxy t arguments from functions that now take TypePath t or TypeSPath t
   9. More quickcheck properties
* 10. Restore schema migration mechanism
  11. Eliminate the nested splice from makePaths so we can use the typegraph stuff in th-typegraph.
      Currently the start type needs to be hard coded.
  12. Implement goKey
  13. Instead of a Proxy t argument can we add a t parameter to the monad?  Or to TypePath and TypeSPath?
  14. Move the Path.TypeGraph modules to th-typegraph and re-implement the derive functions there


  15. Would be nice to have a Ppr instance for TypeSPath s instead of (Proxy t, TypeSPath s).
      The difficulty is applying the ViewType type function when necessary without the Q monad.
  16. Renamed or replaced:
         expandType' -> unE . expandType
  17. Speed up diff
