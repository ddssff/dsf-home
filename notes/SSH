How to set up a machine so it can ssh to upload@deb.seereason.com:

Make sure this is in /etc/sudoers (using visudo):

    Defaults        env_reset,env_keep=SSH_AUTH_SOCK
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add

ssh-keygen (choose pass phrase)
sudo cp .ssh/id_rsa* /root/.ssh/
ssh-copy-id upload@deb.seereason.com
ssh-add

Allows logging in using the certificate AWS.pem:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/AWS.pem
