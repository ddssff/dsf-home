Cabal and cabal-install
-----------------------

1. Building ghcjs requires the cabal option --solver=topdown, which
   was removed after version 1.24.0.2
2. Ghc-8 requires cabal-install-1.24.0.2 to install packages
3. Building cabal-install-1.24.0.2 is failing because it isn't
   setting the name of the Cabal package to libghc-cabal2-dev.
4. Building it by hand (with dpkg-buildpackage) gives out of date
   dependency hackage-security.  Autobuilt and uploaded this.
5. Build deps of cabal-install now install.  Build of cabal-install
   fails because of mismatches betweeen libghc-cabal-dev provided by
   ghc-8.0.2 and libghc-cabal2-dev.  Can we remove libghc-cabal2-dev?
   The build dependencies in cabal-install should actually read
   ghc | libghc-cabal-dev to get the built in Cabal library.
6. Need to withdraw haskell-cabal2 from the repository and rebuild
   hackage-security.
7. Installed cabal-install-1.24 from hvr's repo.  Now building
   autobuilder.  Remove the cabal2 target.
8. Autobuild and upload autobuilder-group.  AutoBuilder target is
   trying to installcabal-1.22.5.0-2.  Why?  Luckily I cleaned out
   the quilt and debianize directories.
9. Clean out the remaining cabal-2 package with --flush-pool
   --flush-depends.  Need to update cabal-debian for cabal-2 BTW.

Logging
-------

The logging facility we have been using just keeps an open file handle
- this keeps log rotation from working.  Switching from
System.Log.Handler.Simple to System.Log.Handler.Syslog fixed this
issue, but how to get it to work?

1. Modify call to openlog to use facility LOCAL1
2. Add file to /etc/syslog.d/30-appraisalscribe.log containing "local1.* /var/log/appraisalscribe.log"
3. Change line "*.*;auth,authpriv.none -/var/log/syslog" to "*.*;auth,authpriv.none;local1.none -/var/log/syslog" in 50-default.conf
3. Create file /var/log/appraisalscribe.log and change ownership to syslog.adm
4. Restart logger: service syslog restart

logging-facade
--------------

This package provides a simple (perhaps overly simple) front end for
logging, with packages logging-facade-systemd and
logging-facade-journald each supplying a LogSink value which
encapsulate the back ends.  It only provides functions for
manipulating the LogSink and for sending messages to the log.

libsystemd-journal
------------------

This package provides functions for
  1. Constructing messages using the journald structure,
  2. Sending these messages to a log
  3. Reading journald logs
