# Install newdist on deb.seereason.com et. al

	apt-get install newdist gnupg2
	rsync ~/.gnupg from old server
	Install postfix (options?  I just tried local only)

# Remove a package from the local repo

	sudo newdist --root=/home/dsf/.autobuilder/localpools/trusty-seereason --layout=Flat --remove=trusty-seereason,main,haskell-zlib=0.6.1.1-0+seereason1~trusty1

Be sure to rebuild autobuilder-seereason with the changes that
inspired this removal. Â Also, uninstall the package from the depend
environment if it got installed during previous build:

	sudo newdist --root=/home/dsf/.autobuilder/dists/trusty-seereason/depend/work/localpool --layout=Flat --remove=trusty-seereason,main,haskell-zlib=0.6.1.1-0+seereason1~trusty1

Just to be on the safe side:

	rsync -aHxS --delete /home/dsf/.autobuilder/dists/trusty-seereason/depend/ /home/dsf/.autobuilder/dists/trusty-seereason/build


Other packages may also have built against the new package, so the
--allow-build-dependency-regressions flag will be needed.

	cabal build
	dist/build/autobuilder-seereason/autobuilder-seereason trusty-seereason --allow-build-dependency-regressions --all-targets > LOG01 2>&1
