# To update an SSL certificate:

The site we got it from is http://www.startssl.com/, on expiration we got this email:

This mail is intended for the person who owns a digital certificate issued by the StartSSL™ Certification Authority (http://www.startssl.com/).

The Class 1, client certificate for ddssff@gmail.com and serial number 567576 (8A918) is about to expire in about two weeks. Please log into the StartSSL Control Panel at https://www.startssl.com/?app=12 and get a new certificate for this purpose. Failing to update your client certificate might result in the loss of your account.

Should you have lost the client certificate which was previously issued to you, please register once again - login without the client certificate installed into your browser will not work in that case.

At https://www.startssl.com/?app=12 I chose “Express Lane”.  I filled out my personal information and hit Continue.  I received the verification code and entered it.  After a short delay I reached “Welcome to StartSSL PKI”.

Clicking on “StartSSL Free” leads to a page that directs me to the “Certificate Control Panel”, This goes back to the page with the “Express Lane” button.  Now what?  Lets try “Authenticate”.  That goes to an “SSL Connection Error” page.  Ok, time to try someone else.

The AWS documentation includes this page: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html.  It says we need to get a certificate from a CA (certificate authority), and they link to this page: http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Security/Public_Key_Infrastructure/PKIX/Tools_and_Services/Third_Party_Certificate_Authorities/.   The free options include http://www.cacert.org/, http://www.ssl4net.com/, and http://simpleauthority.com/. 

(11:03:45 AM) jeremy: it gets as far as asking for the client certification -- which I don’t have on this machine
(11:27:04 AM) stepcut: so. it seems that a vulnerability known as the POODLE attack was discovered in SSLv3, so browsers have stopped supporting it recently
(11:27:34 AM) stepcut: so now you need to use tlsv1.0 or 1.1 or 1.2 -- which despite the lower version numbers are actually newer than SSLv3
(11:27:56 AM) david: who/what needs to use those?
