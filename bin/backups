# This is a script to perform automated backups.  The requirements are
# for all files to be backed up onto a different disk from the disk
# holding the original.  It might be even better to back up to a
# different computer, or a different computer on a different site, but
# to me the biggest risk is of individual hard drive failure.

# For this reason, there are two backup directories mounted on /home,
# /home/backup and /home/backup2.  "/home/backups" is a directory
# mounted from the massive drive in this machine (BHD) and holds the
# backups of everthing that is not hosted on that drive.  These are
# known as "TYPE 1" backups. "/home/backups2" is a directory on another drive
# to hold files whose originals are on BHD.  These are known as "TYPE
# 2" backups.

# First we need to verify that
#
#  1) This script is up to date
#  2) The archive script is up to date
#  3) We are running on the right host
#
# This script is bin/backups in the TLA repository
# dsf@foxthompson.net--2004/dsfhome--upstream--1.  Lets start by
# seeing if we are up-to-date -- if not we'll have to start over.
# We also give up if there are local changes which have not been
# checked in.

# Is this the right host?  My server's hostname is www.foxthompson.net.

# Finally, where are the backups?  This script will create them on
# /home/backups, so mount something big there.
