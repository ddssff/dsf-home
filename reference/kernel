Options to consider

----------------------
CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE:

If you get this error, try to say Y here:

hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }

If in doubt, say N.


ONFIG_IDE_CHIPSETS:
CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED
ONFIG_REISERFS_PROC_INFO
CONFIG_FB_TRIDENT:

How To

If you want it Right Now and are interested in building a kernel (and are already running a 2.4.23 kernel), do the following (AT YOUR OWN RISK!):

1. CNR the "build-essential" package
2. Go to the product page for kernel-image-lindows-2.4.23, click on Specifications, and then download (shift click) the dsc and tarball links.
3. Unpack them with the console command "dpkg-source -x kernel-image-lindows-2.4.23_2.4.23-20.dsc
4. cd into the resulting kernel-source-lindows-2.4.23-2.4.23 directory
5. Copy debian/control-2.4.23 to debian/control
6. Copy debian/changelog-2.4.23 to debian/changelog
7. Edit debian/config-2.4.23 and change the line CONFIG_PDC202XX_NEW=m to CONFIG_PDC202XX_NEW=y
8. Build the kernel package with the command "dpkg-buildpackage".  It may ask for more packages to be installed, CNR them and try dpkg-buildpackage again.
9. Install the new kernel package with the command "dpkg -i kernel-image-lindows-2.4.23_2.4.23-20_i386.deb"
10. Run jiffyboot just to be on the safe side.  (The install of the kernel package is supposed to do this)
11. Run lilo to make extra extra sure things are working.  Observe any error messages.
12. reboot

DEBUGGING USB-STORAGE DISCONNECT OOPS

build command:
  rm -rf /lib/modules/2.6.12-rc5 &&
    make bzImage modules install modules_install &&
    /sbin/mkinitrd 2.6.12-rc5

Patches that modify config:

  patch-31 - 4/27
  patch-30 - 4/27
  patch-29 - 3/30
  patch-27 - 3/2

Probably patch-29 was from before the problem became a problem.

----------

Tests:  (patches refer to los-kernel-image--los-debian--2.6.10)

patch-29: broken
patch-30: broken
current: broken

config1: broken, essentially identical to 2.6.12 config
config2: broken, patch-31 reversed
config3: patch-29 reversed
config4: most of patch-30 reversed (except for DVB_TTUSB_DEC and the LOGO
		options.)
