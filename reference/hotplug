The storage.pl / storage.ml script manages the following files:

/etc/hotplug/scsi/devices.db - (but not always?)

--------

Script is not trying vfat before msdos on sda1, leads to errors in volume mgr
storage-login script
volume manager is not in the menu
system gets into a state where it can't launch applications
clock gets messed up on install

--------

Getting debug output from /sbin/hotplug:

MESSAGE=`printenv | grep '^\(ACTION\|DEVPATH\|PHYSDEVBUS\|PHYSDEVDRIVER\|SEQNUM\|SUBSYSTEM\|INTERFACE\)=' | tr '\n' ' '`
logger -t "hotplug[$$]" "EVENT: $MESSAGE"
