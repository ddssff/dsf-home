When you want to apply two conflicting patches, it is possible to
resolve the conflict without modifying either patch by generating a
pre-patch and a post patch to be applied before and after the second
patch, assuming you are able to manually resolve the rejected changes.

In essence, the pre-patch reverses the part of the first patch that
caused the conflict, and the post-patch re-applies that change with
the necessary modifications.  Here is the procedre to follow:

1. Attempt to apply the two patches.  Record the failures.
2. Find the hunks in the first patch that caused the failures in
   the second patch and put them into the prepatch.  Continue
   until you can successfully apply all three patches: the first
   patch, then the prepatch with the -R flag, then the second patch.
3. Edit the end result to re-apply the effects of the pre-patch,
   and then generate a post-patch by diffing the affected files.

Much of this could be automated given a nice patch handling library.
